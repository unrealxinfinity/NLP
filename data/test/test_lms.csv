"I felt like the course could've been expanded more and include more interactive elements, like how to use a fire extinguisher, a refresher on where the stickers are located on the extinguisher, and how to spot an extinguisher where you work.

There is an incredible amount of waiting in this course. I had the text read and it would take 30 seconds for the next text to appear or allow me onto the next slide. I also only got 1 question wrong in the test out and had to do every module again. I would rather just do the module(s) related to the questions I got wrong. Very time intensive.,neutral,LMS,

"I really liked this class's structure - it was well organized and had some interactive parts, like hovering over pictures to learn more.  There were also small video segments too.  I found it a bit odd that you can fail all the review questions from a section and still be able to move on to the next section of the course.  The only ""roadblock"" is the final quiz.  Jargon was fairly well explained in the duration of this course.  This is one of the nicer LMS classes I've taken thus far.",polite,LMS,

The institute needs to work harder to make real security controls, instead of relying on users. Accidents happen.",somewhat polite,LMS,

Amazing course! Well defined and one that respects your time.,polite,LMS,
Excellent Material provided in this module.,polite,LMS,
"This training needs a refresh. The training material is only through links that take you to Redirect pages, I ended up with 20-30 tabs open in my browser.

I was doing the training from home via VPN, but I don't think that was the issue.",neutral,LMS,

Way too much information and acronyms for everything. More information means less retention.,neutral,LMS,
"1. This course is too long. 2. Some of the content is not relevant to my site (not  the same terminology/role names and as such very confusing to  learn and also not used or needed for daily practice as ERT member/Leader).

"Training is a wall of text, quiz has a focus on questions which are not related to the subject at hand. Do I really need to know that it outputs the roster as a pdf instead of a csv to be qualified to teach? An interactive tutorial would be much better for teachning this material.",neutral,LMS,

Everyone should take this class!,somewhat polite,LMS,
"It was unfair to the presenters to give such a short time  slot to cover a big topic like this. Due to this, there were no breaks & when the course was completed, it was way past lunch hour. Further, with a huge audience of close to 500 new joinees, there is bound to be chaos. Since the  chat was disabled, participants had to resort to asking questions & since the presenters had a time limit, it was not possible humanly to answer all queries.",somewhat polite,LMS,
By far the most engaging and informative training I've attended thus far.,polite,LMS,

Incredibly long and tedious. Consists entirely of videos which can't be skipped and proceed at a fixed pace. Can't test out of content you already know. Took over an hour for something I could have reviewed in 15 minutes.,impolite,LMS,

Arc flash room was a cinematic masterpiece,polite,LMS,
"Ok, But keep the environment self contained. The job aids should be slides themselves or presented in a manner to instruct / impart necessary information within the course.",somewhat polite,LMS,
Great Course but can be improved with regards to slides. I believe there are glitches in slideshow.,polite,LMS,

"Considering the fact that 100% is required to pass, it would be good to know answers after the wrong one is clicked.",somewhat polite,LMS,
Question 8 of 15 is misleading and incorrect in my opinion. The popup message does not make sense based on the selections I made. And driving defensively is not a traffic rule so it should not a valid/correct selection based on the question.,neutral,LMS,
Truly awful. Needs to be reworked.,impolite,LMS,
Great orientation by the instructor.  Well paced and did a good job with the online engagement piece.,polite,LMS,
"Very eye opening.  It applies to every aspect of your life, work, family, friends.  Worth the time.",polite,LMS,
"The content of the course would've been invaluable were the Institution  in a business of personal growth, family/marriage counseling, self-help, etc. I'm not saying it's not useful, but trying to not hurt other people's feelings is not necessarily how we become industry leaders and innovators (consider Steve Jobs or Elon Musk). I'll probably not get many to agree with me, which is fine. And I'm not saying the course is not useful, but why in the world do we need to spend four hours in a classroom, mostly watching videos and participating in the silly exercises? Do we really need an exercise to illustrate that it's not good to be a distracted listener? Are we five year olds? There is absolutely no reason why this could not be turned into an 1-1.5 hour long online course, which would be a much better use of our time (and people willing to take it in a group setting should have this option, too).",impolite,LMS,
"Terrible, there are a lot of links to click on that are casually mentioned to use. Each link has tons of information to sift through. Why not take the most important info and break it down, like every other training?",impolite,LMS,

I like the layout of this class.,polite,LMS,
Excellent Face-2-Face session. Kudos to them for so enthusiastically sharing the information on HR Policies and Benefits and guiding us about the important actions needed from new joinees.,polite,LMS,
"Good and useful information for safety using noble gases and information provided in small ""chunks"".  The slides had some interactive elements.  Jargon without explanations are minimal.  There's pictures that show and help describe processes and PPE.  The graphics look modern and clean.  The process to submit a quiz question is clunky though - you have to click on a tiny check box outside the margin of the quiz; this keeps me from rating this 5 stars.  I honestly wish this course was longer and went into even more detail because of it's higher than average quality.",polite,LMS,
There was text overlapping making it hard to read. The videos were hard to see do to turning white for some reason. I had a slide that kept skipping to the next one. This course should be redone.,neutral,LMS,

"Takes just a handful of minutes to warn you of potential serious pitfalls, with clear examples. Excellent.",polite,LMS,
Good class. It is a validation to show small things are matter in communication,somewhat polite,LMS,
Course needs revising.,neutral,LMS,
"The content delivery itself was fine, but the quiz and knowledge checks remove opportunity for on the spot learning because they do not display the correct answer when you get one wrong. The given options for the safety systems questions are similarly worded, so you're choosing the ""best"" answer rather than the singularly correct one. Knowing the more correct answer would be nice.",somewhat polite,LMS,
The quiz content is very specific (tactical steps) but then you have to acknowledge that it changes frequently and to always use the up to date job aids. Not a good use of time that could be better spent prepping to teach the course.,neutral,LMS,
Perfectly designed,polite,LMS,
"The course was good. The links need to be updated. Inclusion is migrating to a Sharepoint and the links are old, sometimes containing no content.",neutral,LMS,
"Mercifully short, but NOT for those new to version control.  If you're just starting out, the admonitions will not make any sense at all.  A course on version control should be a prerequisite.",impolite,LMS,
I think this training shouldn't be mandatory. The training can't be done in 4 hours with only 1 break of 15 minutes. I suffer on this training. Please or prepare it better or save our precious time. PLEASEEEEEEEEEEEE!!!!!!!!,impolite,LMS,
Half the questions asked are not answered in the course.,neutral,LMS,

Useful information put together to provide a glance at HR services. Thank you,polite,LMS,
 Here's my constructive feedback: 1.  Two questions have a font significantly smaller than the rest. 2. The question on updating No Shows for prereqs has an answer that is not found in the job aids.  The quiz says move to waitlist.  The most recent job aid says that learner should be marked Unsuccessful. 18yrs taking classes at the Institution & this was the worst ever.  Giving people a stack of documents & a quiz is not teaching people how to use the tools for instructors.  I am sure the course owner will take these comments & improve this course.,somewhat polite,LMS,

"Horrible. Would rate 0 if I could. Most of the questions made no sense, had more than one answer when it didn't say I needed more than one, and some of the questions you couldn't even find the answer to in the training. It's just garbage and needs to be redone",impolite,LMS,
"An Inner source page should be created with the reporting links and these rules. RIght now all I can find is an informal, unofficial BKM someone created (without these security tips)",neutral,LMS,

Waste of time. Just give us simple short instructions to read.  A course for this is just dumb.,impolite,LMS,
Course does its best to offset a system with poorly chosen defaults. This is an information leak waiting to happen. A user should have to very explicitly opt-in to sharing information in public.,impolite,LMS,
Fine refresher for Onboarding,somewhat polite,LMS,
Great course. The video lectures were very interesting. Also the interactive sessions in between were very nice.,polite,LMS,
This course was pretty decent.  My only gripe with it is that you have to click next and cannot click on the side menu to advance the slides.  To further enhance the accessibility of this course I'd suggest re-time captioning for the audio vs. a transcript.,neutral,LMS,
The test out at 100% is ridiculous and will just waste your time if you miss a single question. It then also does not cover what you missed but you have to do the whole course. Very wasteful of my time.,impolite,LMS,

It's questionable the value to make people to go thru the course/quiz. Simply provide the MUST-FOLLOW instructions and guidance on shipment is more appreciated.,somewhat polite,LMS,
The course itself is good. Short and to the point. But they need to collaborate with others to speed up reporting status to decrease provisioning time and avoid losing more work time,somewhat polite,LMS,
